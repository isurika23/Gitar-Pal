# 🎸 GuitarPal – Smart Guitar Learning Assistant

**GuitarPal** is an embedded system designed to assist beginners in learning the guitar more effectively and interactively. By placing addressable LEDs under each string at every fret and using touch sensors to detect finger placement, this system provides real-time visual guidance and feedback through a connected mobile app.

## 🚀 Project Goal

To create a low-cost, extendable guitar learning tool that:
- Guides users with LED-lit note/chord positions
- Detects and verifies correct finger placement
- Provides real-time feedback via a mobile application
- Makes practice intuitive and motivating for beginners

## 🔧 Key Features (MVP)
- Individually addressable LED strips for visual fret guidance
- Capacitive/resistive touch sensors to detect correct finger positions (detecting method is TBD)
- Bluetooth communication with a custom mobile app
- Real-time accuracy feedback through the app

## 🧩 Tech Stack

### 📱 Mobile App (Flutter)

### ⚙️ Embedded System
- **Microcontroller:** ESP32 (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth, GPIO support)
- **Sensors:** (TBD)
- **Visuals:** WS2812B addressable RGB LED strips
